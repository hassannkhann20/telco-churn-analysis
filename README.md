# Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

This project analyzes customer churn using a structured analytics workflow and presents key insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
The goal is to understand churn patterns and identify high-risk customer segments using business-relevant metrics and visuals.

---

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical business problem where customers stop using a company’s service.  
In this project, customer data is analyzed to answer questions such as:
- Which customers are more likely to churn?
- How contract type, tenure, and payment method affect churn
- What patterns can help businesses reduce churn

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** Telco Customer Churn dataset  
- **Records:** 7,043 customers  
- **Key fields:**  
  - Customer ID  
  - Churn (Yes / No)  
  - Contract Type  
  - Tenure  
  - Payment Method  
  - Monthly Charges  
  - Internet Service  

The dataset was cleaned before analysis to ensure correct data types and consistent values.

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** – exploratory analysis and data validation  
- **Python** – data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- **Power BI** – interactive dashboard and visualization  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and project sharing  

---

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides a clear, business-focused view of customer churn.

### Dashboard Highlights
- **KPI Cards**
  - Total Customers
  - Churned Customers
  - Active Customers
  - Churn Rate (%)

- **Key Visuals**
  - Customer Distribution by Churn Status (Donut Chart)
  - Churn by Contract Type
  - Churn by Customer Tenure
  - Churn by Payment Method

- **Interactive Features**
  - Slicers for Contract, Payment Method, Internet Service, and Gender
  - Cross-filtering across all visuals

---

## Key Insights

- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate  
- Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn  
- Electronic check payment method shows higher churn  
- Churned customers tend to have higher monthly charges  

These insights help identify high-risk customer segments and support retention strategies.
